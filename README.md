# Angular Test

## Purpose

As it is difficult to fully assess somebody’s abilities at an interview, particularly their programming skills, we give a small programming exercise to all candidates. The problem is a fairly simple one, which should be completed in the applicant’s own time.

This is an opportunity for the candidate to show their engineering skill and craftwork. We are looking for engineering best practice. The test will be reviewed accordingly. 

This is a very important part of our hiring process. Therefore we recommend that candidates give this adequate consideration and address this task as they would do for any other professional assignments in their current workplace.

## Instructions 

We would much prefer that you submit a complete software implementation that demonstrates modern engineering best practices.  However we also appreciate that to provide a complete solution we may be expecting too much of the candidates time. If you are pressed for time, we recommend you provide additional content detailing areas that, given more time, you would address or have done differently. 

The exercise is defined in the ./WebApplication1/README.txt file.
